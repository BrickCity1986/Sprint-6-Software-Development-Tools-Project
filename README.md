# Project Title

This project is a web application that provides a dashboard for analyzing car advertisement data. It allows users to explore the dataset, visualize it using histograms and scatterplots, and toggle certain behaviors through checkboxes.
```

3. Provide a high-level overview of the methods and libraries used in your project. This will help others understand the technologies involved. For example:

```
## Methods and Libraries Used

- Python programming language
- Streamlit framework for building web applications
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Plotly Express library for interactive data visualization
- Altair library for additional visualization capabilities
```

4. Explain the steps for others to run your project on their local machine. Provide clear instructions and any required setup steps. For example:

```
## Running the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYourUsername%2FYourProject.git&data=05%7C01%7C%7Cf9d1a73c1c1d47a0cdf108dbc7651f65%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638323009362882470%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7PyvN7n2kExHj7eEu8zM2DBpaI5uD3SFMEFRPDWy2K4%3D&reserved=0
```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.

3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv) and place it in the root directory of the project.

5. Launch the web application using Streamlit. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address provided by Streamlit (e.g., [http://localhost:8501)]http://localhost:8501).

7. You should now see the web application dashboard, where you can interact with the data and explore the visualizations.
